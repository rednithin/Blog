# About

Like most kids in the 2000s, I was introduced to computers at a gaming cafe, where we used to pay around â‚¹10 for an hour or so.
We used to play titles such as [GTA: Vice City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City), [GTA: San Andreas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas), [NFS: Most Wanted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted_(2005_video_game)) etc. 

During my 10<sup>th</sup>, I was introduced to Java.
But I had difficulty in understanding how the programs worked so I just mugged them up for exams.
Very soon, I was introduced to the two most important tutors in my life.
With their help I was able to become good at Mathematics and Programming.

In college, I mostly worked on competitive programming, automation, web development and a little bit of deep learning.
My first job however required me to mostly work on React.
But the thing I enjoyed the most was to improve developer experience & reduce fatigue via automation.

As far as hobbies go. I love to recreate dishes I enjoy, at home.
And also I recently started gardening to grow ingredients needed right at home.
